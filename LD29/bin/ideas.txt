Theme: Beneath the Surface  (Pod powierzchni¹)

Interpretation:
	Beneath the surface of the Earth
	Beneath an object
		Table
		Toilet seat
	Beneath the water level (ocean?)
	Beneath ice
	Other planet?
	
Type:
	Economy + Strategy
	Escape
	

Ideas: 
	Travel to the Earth's core
	Small animal kingdom
	Bugs?
	Nuclear bunker
	You're a bacteria underneath toilet seat
	Plague - bacteria version?
	Dig to hell
	Submarine warfare
	Oil Tycoon
	Archaeology
	Coal Mine Tycoon
	Bacteria survival underneath the skin ( levels = parts of the body, element of strategy - clicking to achieve new points/tokens?)
	Food chain in the ocean
	Resource extraction - you start on the surface (selling resources for $$$ which you use to improve your equipment)
	Phobias?
	Coffin Tycoon
	
	
Idea for now:
	Economy + Strategy
	Beneath the surface of the earth (or another planet)
	Your job is to drill for resources, sell them and improve your equipment to dig even deeper. 
	
Alternative:
	Theme: Ants' nest, you're the keeper
	
	World:
		Water tank
		Or open world
		
	Mechanics:
		You control groups of ants and aid them in performing their job.
		You start with a couple of ants and try to create a healthy environment.
		Mechanics kinda like Prison Architect but not necessarily that strict.
	
	Goal:
		LD Intermediate:
			The nest will be a subject to many different attacks. Your role is to protect it from those attacks by raising fighter ants.
			Those ants however need food to survive. You'll have to use different kinds of ants to perform their role in getting resources, breeding and raising fighters.
			Time is the key and that's how you'll be getting scored - time of survival.
			
		Final:
